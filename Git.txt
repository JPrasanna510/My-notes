Git hub-- repository(
Git-- version control system (local system)

Staging are(promised)---> commit(promise fulfilled)---> Push to remote repository
Above are the three steps to push out code from local machine to remote repository.

git add filename
git commit -m "Meaningful message"
sign in into accounts in VScode. we need GITHUB pull requests extension to push the code.

git push origin main(or branch)

git log----> gives you all the commits and along with id's.

M--modified

U--Untracked file.[once added then changes to A, means added]

If you have a folder and wanted to keep it in repo, then use init.
git add .  ---> makes all the files in the folder added.

git remote -v  [we can check whether the same repo is available or not which is alrdy there in local machine.]

git push -u origin main   --> After this we can use direct push and no need to mention -u origin main as it remembers with the above command.






repo---remote folder

git lens extension
git branch (we have to go to the main branch)
git init
git add .
git checkout -b main(if it is not happened here, we have to manually by copying the url from GitHub)

git remore add origin link 
git remote -v
commint -m
git push origin main
git pull origin main
