Flex- grow: even though there is a width, then also it takes entire width of the screen
by default value is 1; we can also make it 0 so that takes exact width

flex-shrink: we can shrink the elements .

flex-basis: here also it takes the entire width

article: nth-of-type(2){
flex-grow: 2;}
/*It makes the second article grows double than other elements.*/


flex-basis:200px; even though there is a width for element, it takes only 200px;
after this if you have flex-grow then again it takes entire screen.
