<!--cascading style sheet
used to makeup the html doc.
used to style and layout webpage.
Types of CSS:
Inline
Internal
External
Which overrides?
inline>internal>external

to change font color and style
<h1 style="color: red; font-family: cursive;">This is my heading.</h1>
this is also called inline CSS

Internal CSS: If you write the styles on the same page but not inside a tag, but inside the head tag, we call it as internal CSS
<head>
<style>
h1{
color: red;
font-family: cursive;
}
</style>
</head>

external CSS: we can make separate file. 
h1{
color: red;
font-family: cursive;
}

we have to link this .css fine to html file
<link rel="stylesheet" href="file.css">

CSS selectors:
universal selector: we use *{ property: value}
body selector: 
we use id, class, nested class here.
If we want to give different colors for each h1 tag. then we use id
<h1 id="heading1"></h1>
<h1 id="heading2"></h1>
We have to use #
#heading1{P:v}
#heading2{P:v}
<h1 class="heading1"></h1>
If we want to use the same styling to different components then we use class.
To use this we use "."
.heading1{p:v}
.heading2{p:v}

We can give padding in a single line 
padding: top right down left,

padding: 10 20 30 40;

padding: 40 50; (take top and bottom as 40, left and right as 50)
margin is also same like padding

Margin collapsing:  The margin space between next to next boxes will be taken as the highest amount
if box1

Even though the sizes of two boxes same, based on the padding the size may vary.
box sizing:  border-box; // it reduces the content height will be reduced as per padding and border.
box sizing encorporates the size of the content inside the element. by default all projects use this
*{
    bbox sizing:  border-box;
    margin:0; // it removes default margin size of 8px in the body.
    
}
margin-collapse: the merging of adjacent element margins.


in Inline elements, we cant give custom height and width, Margin also we can give only horizontally.
we can use display property to change the behaviour.
